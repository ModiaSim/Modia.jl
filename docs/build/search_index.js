The defined model is symbolically processed (for example, equations might be analytically differentiated) with algorithms from package ModiaBase.jl. From the transformed model a Julia function is generated that is used to simulate the model with integrators from DifferentialEquations.jl. The basic type of the floating point variables is usually Float64, but can be set to any type FloatType<:AbstractFloat via @instantiateModel(..., FloatType = xxx), for example it can be set to Float32, DoubleFloat, Measurement{Float64}, StaticParticles{Float64,100}.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Installation","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The package is registered and is installed with (Julia >= 1.5 is required):","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"julia> ]add TinyModia","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Furthermore, one or more of the following packages should be installed in order  to be able to generate plots:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"julia> ]add ModiaPlot_PyPlot        # if plotting with PyPlot desired\r\n        add ModiaPlot_GLMakie       # if plotting with GLMakie desired\r\n        add ModiaPlot_WGLMakie      # if plotting with WGLMakie desired\r\n        add ModiaPlot_CairoMakie    # if plotting with CairoMakie desired","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"It is recommended to also add the following packages, in order that all tests and examples can be executed in your standard environment:","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"julia> ]add Unitful, DifferentialEquations, Measurements\r\n        add MonteCarloMeasurements, Distributions","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Release-Notes","page":"Home","title":"Release Notes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#Version-0.8.0","page":"Home","title":"Version 0.8.0","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"xxx","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Version-0.7.3","page":"Home","title":"Version 0.7.3","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Evaluation and propagation of parameter expressions (also in simulate!(..., merge=Map(...))).
